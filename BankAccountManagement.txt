Project: Bank Account System in Python

Description:
This project demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Features:

Account class with private balance and methods for deposit, withdrawal, and balance check.

Savings and Current classes inherit from Account and calculate interest differently.

Validates numeric input and ensures transactions respect account balance.

Demonstrates real-world banking operations using Python OOP.

Concepts Used:

Encapsulation: Private balance attribute in Account.

Inheritance: Savings and Current inherit from Account.

Polymorphism: get_interest() method behaves differently in each subclass.

Usage:

Create instances of Savings or Current.

Use deposit(amount), withdraw(amount), and get_balance() methods.

Call get_interest() on savings or current accounts.
